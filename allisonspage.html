<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Allison but I also go by Allie! I'm a third-year BACS major, 
  and I'm also working towards a focal path in Cybersecurity. I transferred my second-year from Northern Virginia Community College 
  and I stayed home my first semester due to COVID. So this year is my first 'real' year at UVA. When I was at NOVA, I took some ITE classes that taught me 
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked with a group to create a website about a fake entrepreneurship using only HTML and CSS and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad that 
  I have experience in this coding language that I can apply in this internship. I also know Java, Python, and C++ coding languages. 
  I also took extra courses on Coursera in SQL, so I have some experience in that. I sometimes enjoy coding when I can actually make the code work. 
  There is something satisying about fixing something that you've been spending hours 
  on...otherwise it's the most stressful thing I have ever done.

  This is my first internship with IPP,
  and first internship ever. I'm really excited to work with all of you and learn more about software development. 
  I am Vice President of She's the First at UVA, a club sponsoring awareness of girls' rights and education. 
  I'm an early riser which allows me to have a job that I go to in the early hours of the morning (5:45 AM).  </p>
