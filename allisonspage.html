<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Allison but you can call me Allie if you'd like! I'm a third-year BACS major, 
  and I'm also working towards a focal path in Cybersecurity. I transferred my second-year from Northern Virginia Community College 
  and I stayed home my first semester due to COVID. So this year is my first 'real' year at UVA. This is my first internship with IPP,
  and first internship ever. I'm really excited to work with all of you and learn more about software development. 
  I am Vice President of She's the First at UVA, a club sponsoring awareness of girls' rights and education. 
  I'm an early riser which allows me to have a job that I go to in the early hours of the morning (5:45 AM). I did a lot of coding in community college 
  (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java) and I continued Java and learned Python at UVA. I also took extra courses on Coursera in SQL, so I have some experience in that.
  I sometimes enjoy coding when I can actually make the code work. There is something satisying about fixing something that you've been spending hours 
  on...otherwise it's the most stressful thing I have ever done. </p>
