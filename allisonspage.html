<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Allison but you can call me Allie if youâ€™d like! Iâ€™m a third-year BACS major, and Iâ€™m also working towards a focal path in Cybersecurity. I transferred my second-year from Northern Virginia Community College and I stayed home my first semester due to COVID. So this year is my first â€œrealâ€ year at UVA. This is my first internship with IPP, and first internship ever. Iâ€™m really excited to work with all of you and learn more about software development. I am Vice President of Sheâ€™s the First at UVA, a club sponsoring awareness of girlsâ€™ rights and education. Iâ€™m an early riser which allows me to have a job that I go to in the early hours of the morning (5:45 AM). I did a lot of coding in community college (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java) and I continued Java and learned Python at UVA. I also took extra courses on Coursera in SQL, so I have some experience in that. I sometimes enjoy coding when I can actually make the code work. There is something satisying about fixing something that you've been spending hours on...therwise it's the most stressful thing I have ever done. </p>
